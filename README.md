**About**
LinkRoom is a Zoom clone that allows users to conduct video conferences, share screens, schedule future meetings, and record calls. This project showcases my skills in building real-time communication applications using Next.js, shadcn/ui, and TailwindCSS. There's also usage of the Stream API for video calling as well as the Clerk User Management API for user authentication.
